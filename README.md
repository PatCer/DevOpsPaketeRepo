    Pull Request:
      In Git A pull request is a Request made by a developer to get their code commited to the online repository.
    Branch:
      A branch is when a dev creates another branch of code on which he works, which means that when he commits this branch it will not ovverride the main code but will be saved separately. In this way multiple people can work on the same Repository but you can          always see what changes where made by who and can change it any time.
